Polygon Mesh Objects

1. Sphere objects created

User Input/Interaction

2. Clicking a planet name shows the planet selected

3. Clicking view all restores to full planetary view

4. Clicking obliterate causes the selected planet to be destroyed

Texture Mapping

5. Planet meshes look like the surface of the actual planet

Hierarchical transforms to represent the solar system

6. Planets are children of the sun

7. Moons are children of their planets

Particle Physics-

1. The sphere mesh is removed

2. Particles emit at source (cannon nozzle or landing point of projectile)

3. Particles vary in color of planet/moon that is exploding

4. Particles move outwards with force of explosion (no gravity)

5. Particles expire (vanish) after N = 4 seconds
